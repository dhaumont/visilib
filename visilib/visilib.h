# Visilib #

The visilib project aims to provide an efficient C++ library for exact visibility computation in 3D.

The main feature of the current version is exact occlusion query between two polygons, a polygonand a segment, or between two segments, and allows to answer the fundamental question "Are these two polygons mutually visible?".The principal application is from - region occlusion cullingand exact Potentially Visible Set computation(PVS).The visibility determination is exactand make no simplification, in opposition to conservative or aggressive visibility methods : visilib performs the complete penumbra fusion of the occluders, by the mean of CSG operations in Plï¿½cker space.All the technical details are described in the companion paper "A Low Dimensional Framework for Exact Polygon-to-Polygon Occlusion Queries", presented at EGSR 2005 (cf.download section)

###Features###

- Available exact visibility query :
-polygon to polygon
- segment to segment
- segment to polygon
- point to point
- point to segment
- point to polygon

- robust arithmetic computation via exact artithmetic via CGALand LEDA libraries(multiple precision arithmetic combined with interval arithmetic computations)
- fast ray - triangle intersection based on Intel Embree library
- easy to use : header only library

- Visibility performed via CSG(Constructive Solid Geometry) operations in Plucker space :
-Optimal minimum polytope building algorithm in Plucker space
- Polytope splitting algorithm using only skeleton of polytopes(verticesand edges)
- Silhouette optimization algortihm reducing drastically the number of CSG operations
- Guided aperture samplingand early termination : rays are casted in the visibility apertures left by the previously processed occluders, leading to early termination in case of mutual visibility
- Occluder selection using previous queries
- Computational Geometry predicates in Plucker space

###Applications###
- Potentially Visible Set computation(PVS)
- Sound propagation(edge diffraction)
- Shadow and lighting computation
- Robotic
